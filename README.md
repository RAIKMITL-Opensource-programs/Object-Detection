# Object-Detection
  The goal of object detection is to locating instance of  custom object in a image and then recognize the object. A set of training images 
  were provided for this purpose.
  
  The objective was to design and implement a custom object detector in Python using Convolutional Neural Network with Keras ,OpenCV and Tensorflow that will detect object
  as well as recognize the object based on the trained images provided.
